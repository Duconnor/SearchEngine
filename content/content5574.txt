 【新华网英文版】China Focus: Chinese graduates vie for civil servantWang Qiang, a professor at NanjingUniversity's School of Government, advised graduates to be rational when making choices."Students should deepen their understanding on related sectors and make choices based on their own conditions. There is no best job, but the best fit," he said.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-11/02/c_132853898.htm    发布于 2013年11月04日  点击数：979 BEIJING, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Shuttling between employment fairs and job-related seminars, post-graduate student Han Xiaomeng is stressed. She is preparing for her national civil servant examination on Nov. 24.Han, who is studying at the School of Journalism and Communication at TsinghuaUniversity is taking the exam as she wants "a stable and comfortable job with secured permanent residence."She said, "The economic situation is changeable. However, being a government employee is a secure job covered by a sound welfare network."With government-covered health care, subsidized housing, high pension rates, slim chances of being laid off, for many applicants, a civil servant role is a safe job.Statistics showed that applicants taking the exam in 2012, 2013 and 2014 totaled 1.23 million, 1.38 million and 1.52 million respectively. However, they stood a slim chance of securing a job in the public service.On average, 77 applicants competed for one position this year, of which 37 positions have an enrollment ratio of more than 1,000:1. The ratio is 7,192:1 for the most wanted government post.As usual, an avalanche of applicants applied for government agencies such as finance, taxation and customs, while meteorology and earthquake attracted few.Han is looking for a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Its application ratio is around 57:1.Yang Xiaolong, a student from the School of International Studies at PekingUniversity, has also been preparing for the exam"My major fits well with the civil service, and I want to put what I've learnt into practice," the 24-year-old said."Maybe I'm influenced by my family," said Yang, whose father is a civil servant.According to a survey carried by the Beijing News on "why are you taking the public service exam," 85.4 percent of 6,382 respondents chose "stable job," 83.4 percent picked "sound payment and welfare," while 56.4 percent opted for "high social prestige." Another 37.1 percent chose "greater power."A civil servant surnamed Liu, who has worked at a ministry department for four years suggested applicants think twice."Despite the advantages, a government job is not suitable for everyone. You must buckle down and start from the grassroots and make progress step by step," he said.Zhan Hongyi, an associate professor at the School of Education of the Renmin University of China attributed civil servant "fever" to multiple factors."For instance, the social security system is yet to be developed, people bear a heavy burden on health care and owning an apartment, the employment situation is not optimistic, and the entrepreneurial environment for the young still needs to be improved," he said.Once these problems are solved, public service "fever" might cool down, Zhan said."Young people should adjust their attitudes, consider entering an emerging industry, and pursue their ambitions and realize their dreams," he said.（Shen Qing）原文链接： (采编/李秋实）
